# Airport Heatmap

This heatmap shows the density of airports over the state of Alaska. Red areas are places with a relatively high number of airports, while green areas have none. Tis uses location data for major airports in the state of Alaska and was made in QGIS.

There are two noticeable clusters- a larger one near Anchorage and a smaller one near Fairbanks.
