# Median Income in King County, Washington
This map shows land area in King County and utilizes a color ramp to show median income by census tract.

Data is from the American Community Survey 5-year dataset for 2015-2019. I utilized R and packages like tidycencus and ggplot2. R code and walkthrough can be downloaded [here](/Project4/MedianIncomeRCode.Rmd).
