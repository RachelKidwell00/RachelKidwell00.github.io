# Hotspot Analysis of Asian Residents in Pennsylvania

ACS 5-year data were used to analyze the prevalence of Asian residents in Pennsylvania by census tract. Hotspot analysis used the Getis-Ord local Gi* statistic with categories for high, low and insignificant clustering. The tracts only showed high and insignificant clustering. The analysis and figures were done in R with packages like tidycensus, tidyverse, sf and ggplot2.
